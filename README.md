# keyboardpal
A basic implementation of a typing emulator, used for instances where its not easy to copy paste eg Java terminal emulators 

It has two inputs to help with automation where you might have alternate text to type out in certain situations.

Note that tkinter is not in the requiremennts.txt as you have to install it as an operating system package:

python3-tkinter
